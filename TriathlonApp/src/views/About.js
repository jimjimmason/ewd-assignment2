      <h1> About Thurles Triathlon Club </h1>
      <p>
      	Thurles Triathlon Club is based in Mid Tipperary, Ireland. The Club was created in 2015, by a small number of individuals who shared the  common interest in the different disciplines encompassing the sport that is Triathlon. The primary goal is to invite & welcome in new members, of all abilities, and help and support them to reach whatever goal they aim for, whether that be improved health, increased fitness, or to actively compete in Triathlon, Duathlon events.

Triathlon has become very popular in recent years and continues to grow. The club welcomes people interested in any aspect of the sport. There is no obligation on anyone to compete in events, if people just wish to participate in individual aspects, such as cycling that we also  encourage, so come along and get involved and get active again if that is your goal.

Club Members regularly participate in events, such as Duathlons, Triathlons, 5 K & 10 K Running events, to Half & Full Marathons, and throw in a little Adventure Racing events to make it interesting.
